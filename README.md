# Bulbapedia_Scraper

Python webscraper that uses the Beautiful Soup package to parse and scrape Pokemon types and entry number from Bulbapeida. Includes a custom GUI created using CustomTkinter package that allows user to enter a Pokemon's name and recieve the Pokemon's pokedex entry number and types. 

# Future Plans
In the future I may expand the scraper to find the type advantages and disadvantages and include this into the GUI. Furthermore the GUI is pretty bare-bones right now and could use some extra customization to create a better GUI. The search function could also be improved with auto suggestions of Pokemon names in the future.
